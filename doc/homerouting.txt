StrongLeaf HomeRouting Design Document
=====================================
Holger Freyther <holger@freyther.de>


Introduction
------------

The HomeRouting system is responsible for making sure that
all MT-SMS will be routed to this system. SMS can then be
converted to SMPP and be forwarded to other systems.


Features, Limitations and Assumptions
-------------------------------------

* Compression of SMS is not supported.
* All un-mappable DCS are not supported.
* No TCAP segmentation for SMPP to MAP conversion


Requirements for deployment
---------------------------

A Debian 64-bit system should be used.



Implementation
--------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The HomeRouting system is handling three parts. The main
function is to handle SRIForSM/mt-ForwardSM/forwardSM and
forward the SMS to a SMPP link. Secondary functions are to
forward SMPP SubmitSM to a pre-configured SMSC and to deliver
a SMPP DeliverSM to a remote system.


MAP MT-SMS to SMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HomeRouting system will receive the MAP SRIForSM
to query the current VLR and IMSI of a subscriber. It
will respond with a fixed per HomeRouting system GT. To
generate the IMSI a rule to modify the MSISDN into a
arbitary IMSI will be used. This way the HomeRouting
system does not need to look-up any data from a database.
The rule must be reversible to allow to remove the new
IMSI prefix with a MSISDN prefix.

The remote system will now attempt to send a forwardSM
or mt-ForwardSM operation to the system. The received
message will be converted to a SMPP DeliverSM and then
be forwarded on the configured SMPP connection. The
SMPP result will be mapped to a MAP result.


SMPP SubmitSM to MAP MO-SMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HomeRouting system can have zero or more rules for
MO-SMS. These rules have a regular expressions for the
source and destination number and can determine to which
SMSC the SMS should be sent to, which MAP operation to
use (forwardSM or mo-ForwardSM) and the validity period
to use.

The rules are looked up in the order they have been
added and the first matching rule will be used.


SMPP DeliverSM to MAP MT-SMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HomeRoutin system can have zero or more rules for
MT-SMS. Each rule can match the source and destination
number and influence which GT translation type to use
for the SRIForSM and the mt-ForwardSM.


Message and Error handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the standard behavior of the HomeRouting system.


MAP MT-SMS to SMPP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


|======================================================
|Nr.   | Condition		| MAP result
|M-MT01 | No SMPP connection | absentSubscriber (depending on V2/V3)
|M-MT02 | Missing IMSI in sm-RP-DA | unexpectedDataValue
|M-MT03 | Missing IMSI->MSISDN mapping | unexpectedDataValue
|M-MT04 | SMS canâ€™t be converted to SMPP DeliverSM | sm-DeliveryFailure
|M-MT05 | No SMPP response |absentSubscriber (depending on V2/V3)
|M-MT06 | SMPP Error | sm-DeliveryFailure
|M-MT07 | SMPP Success | returnResultLast
|======================================================



SMPP DeliverSM to MAP MT-SMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|======================================================
|Nr. | Condition		| SMPP result
|S-MT01| No route | SMPP Command Status 8
|S-MT02| MAP Failure | SMPP Command Status 8
|S-MT03| MAP Success | SMPP Command Status 0
|======================================================



SMPP SubmitSM to MAP MO-SMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

|======================================================
|Nr. | Condition		| SMPP result

|S-MO01| No route | SMPP Command Status 8
|S-MO02| MAP Success | SMPP Command Status 0 + Delivery Report
|S-MO03| MAP Failure | SMPP Command Status 8
|======================================================



Quirk Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some SMSCs invoke ROS operations without the TCAP session having a
dialogueRequest/applicationContextName. The HomeRouting system has
a list of local opcode to ApplicationContextName. The current mappings are:

opcode *45*:: Is considered a sendRoutingInfoForSM using the
application context shortMsgGatewayContext-v2.

Configuration using Smalltalk
-----------------------------

The HomeRouting can currently only be configured through
Smalltalk code. One needs to configure Network Service,
the MSISDN/IMSI mapping for all supported prefixes, GTs
to be used and the SMPP connection.

HomeRoutingMOSMSMSISDNConfig
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If useMOForwardSM is used instead of useForwardSM the mo-ForwardSM
operation will be used to communicate with the home SMSC.

HomeRoutingServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case a SMPP Connection should be used for SMPP to MAP but not
the other way around it can be registered using the >>#registerESME:
call of the HomeRouting system.

Monitoring
~~~~~~~~~~

When more messages arrive than are allowed to be queued a syslog
entry will be generated. This can be parsable with other tools.
